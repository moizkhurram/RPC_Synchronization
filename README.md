  <h2>RPC File Synchronization</h2>

  <p>This repository contains code that enables file synchronization between a client and server using Remote Procedure Call (RPC) technology. The synchronization process ensures that a single change in a file on the client-side triggers an automatic update of the corresponding file on the server-side. This functionality is achieved through the implementation of an RPC protocol, allowing seamless communication and synchronization between the two entities.</p>

  <h3>Features</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Bidirectional file synchronization using RPC.</li>
    <li>Automatic detection of changes on the client-side.</li>
    <li>Real-time updates to the server-side file system.</li>
    <li>Efficient and reliable file transfer through RPC calls.</li>
  </ul>
